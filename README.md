# My Lab

This lab is for my personal use.  

## Hardware

This is a list of the hardware I used to create this lab.  It was sourced from Amazon with one exception of the [Kangaroo](#kangaroo) from NewEgg.

### Network

- [Switch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AUEYXIG/): This Netgear will support VLAN and VLAN trunking.  Its not super easy to use and the UI frankly sucks.  It is relatively inexpensive and is silent.
- [Dumb Switch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPVR50A/) (optional): I used this so I only had one cable running from the lab to my house router.
- Cables: I used two colors [Green](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0186AJ5VK/) for Control Plane and [Orange](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017C183EO/) Data Plane.

### Servers

I used [Gigabyte Intel i3-4010U Mini PC](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I05NH9S/8) These come with everything but the Memory and Hard drive.

I also added a [USB nic](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PIW2I96/) to complement the existing network interface to bring the nic count to 2. (they do have a wireless interface I ignored / disabled)

#### Node Type 1

Three hosts that have a [60 GB SSD](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00COFMPAM/) drive and [8 Gigs of Ram](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012TS9UOM/)

#### Node Type 2

Two hosts that have [60 GB SSD](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00COFMPAM/) drive another [240 GB SSD](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A1ZTZNM/) drive and [8 Gigs of Ram](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012TS9UOM/).

#### Kangaroo

I used a [Kangaroo](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883722001) for this host.   Its very small and only $99.00.  The Kangaroo will accept ubuntu 16.04 without issue.  I also added 1 [USB nic](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PIW2I96) to provide wired access.
